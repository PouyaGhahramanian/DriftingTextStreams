# DriftingTextStreams

Welcome to DriftingTextStreams, a repository dedicated to the development of tools for creating and visualizing evolving text streams with induced concept drift in text classification datasets. This project, supported by Tübitak under grant 122E271, is currently in progress and aims to provide valuable resources for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Overview

DriftingTextStreams focuses on providing scripts that enable the creation of text streams with concept drift from existing text classification datasets and tools for visualizing the distribution of concept drift in these streams.

## Features

- **Concept Drift Creation Script**: A script to create text streams with concept drift based on a given text classification dataset.
- **Visualization Script**: A tool for visualizing the concept drift distribution in the constructed text stream.
- **Documentation**: Guidelines on how to use the scripts and interpret the results.

## Getting Started

To use DriftingTextStreams:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pouyaghahramanian/DriftingTextStreams.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd DriftingTextStreams`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

- **Creating Text Streams**: Run the concept drift creation script on your dataset. Instructions can be found in the `script1` folder.
- **Visualizing Concept Drift**: Utilize the visualization script in the `script2` folder to analyze the concept drift in your text stream.
